There was a segfault scanning for plugins, let's make sure our changes to our c code were also take into consideration for our  │
│   gain and delay plugins as we have modified our filter plugin. AAlso, please explain why the gain plugin worked just fine when   │
│   we modified those parameters, when our filter plugin would not. why do they need two different implementations to follow        │
│   parameter changes. shouldn't the gain style reading work?
